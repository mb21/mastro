# Mastro SSG VS Code Extension

This is a VS Code [Web Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/web-extensions) to build your static site inside your browser using vscode.dev or github.dev.

## Usage

Hit `Cmd-Shift-P` and search for `mastro`.

## Develop

    npm run build; npm run open-in-browser

### Architecture

There are three levels of turtles, all containes within one file: `src/extension.ts` (that was we [don't need a bundler](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension)).

#### Extension web worker

Since we're in a VS Code web extension (which is being run in a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), we don't have access to Node.js's modules like `fs`. But we can use [`vscode.workspace.fs`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#FileSystem) and [`vscode.Uri`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Uri).

#### WebviewPanel (server)

The extension calls `vscode.window.createWebviewPanel` and sets its html to the result of `getWebviewContent`. This webview (effectively also just an iframe) replaces Deno as the place where the server-side code is run, i.e. where the static site generation takes place. Look out for:

```js
const { GET } = await import(route.filePath)
```

The Webview has some theming CSS set by VSCode. In the HTML, we render a sort of browser-like address bar, a back button and a giant iframe.

#### iframe (browser)

It is that iframe that takes the role of the browser. The last step is that the output of the static page generation is injected into the iframe. Essentially:

```js
output = await GET(req)
  .then(res => res.text())
iframe.srcdoc = output
```
